# Everything React Blog Series

Everything React is a blog series on React (duh!) written by your's truly on Medium. The goal of this series is to teach people React in a bottom up fashion in 2019. The aim is to start off with basic static apps then entering into dynamic application using Node Python and API such as REST and GraphQL. I will also be focusing on design insights that go into when building a react app from scratch and indicate why I took a certain step when alternate steps were available.
